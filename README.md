## Chris Walker - Musician, Technician, Outdoor Person

This is the readme for the website of Chris Walker. The page you're looking for is [chriswmusic.com](http://chriswmusic.com)

I used to have a Squarespace website, but now I've built a Github.io site, to better learn how to code, and do it for free, no less.

Enjoy your visit; and if you need music, IT or journalistic services, email me at chriswalker@mailbox.org

Peace!

Chris
